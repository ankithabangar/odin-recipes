        <h4>For the dough</h4>

            <li>225g plain flour</li>
            <li>2 tsp sea salt</li>
            <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2l vegetable oil to deep fry</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To make the filling, heat the oil in a frying pan, add the onion and garlic, mix in the spices and fry for 10 mins until soft. 
                <br>Add the vegetables, seasoning and stir well until coated. Add the stock, cover and simmer for 30 mins until cooked. 
                <br>Leave to cool.</li>
            <li>To make the pastry, mix flour and salt into a bowl. Make a well in the centre, add the oil and 100ml water to make a firm dough. 
                <br>Knead the dough on a floured surface for 5-10 mins until smooth and roll into a ball. 
                <br>Cover in cling film and set aside at room temperature for 30 mins.</li>
            <li>Divide the pastry into 12 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a ball and roll out into a circle of 15cm. 
                <br>Divide this circle into two equal pieces with a knife.</li>
            <li>Brush each edge with a little water and form a cone shape around your fingers, sealing the dampened edge. 
                <br>Fill with 1 tbsp mixture and press the two dampened edges together to seal the top of the cone. 
                <br>Repeat with the remaining pastry.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a large deep saucepan to 180C. The oil should come 1/3rd of the way up the pan. 
                <br>Deep fry the samosas in batches for 8-10 mins until crisp and brown. Take out and drain on kitchen paper.</li>
        </ol>
